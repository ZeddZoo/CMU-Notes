With linear circuits, we can often get by pretty easily with Ohm's law, KVL, KCL, etc... 
But once we start talking about non-linear circuit elements, such as a diode, it seems
like we are at a lost for tools to use.

\section{The Problem}
Let's consider the following circuit

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering

  \begin{circuitikz}
  % Drain
  \draw
  (0,0) node[left] {$\VIN$}
  to[short, *-] (1,0)
  to[D*, v=$\vd$] (3,0)
  to[R=$R \eq \SI{10}{\ohm}$] (5,0)
  node[sground, rotate=90] {};
  ;
  \end{circuitikz}
  \label{circuit}
\end{figure}

Suppose that
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\VIN = \SI{8}{\volt}$
  \item $\id = I_s\pa{e^{\vd/\vt} - 1}$, where $I_s = \SI{1e-24}{\ampere}$, $\vt = \SI{25}{\milli\volt}$
\end{itemize}

Solve for the current through the diode.

\section{A Na\"{i}ve Approach}
Hey, KCL works most of the time, so let's try it...

\begin{align*}
  \id &= \frac{\VIN - \vd}{R} \\
  I_s\pa{e^{\vd/\vt} - 1} &= \frac{\VIN - \vd}{R}\\
  I_se^{\vd/\vt} + \frac{\vd}{R} &= \frac{\VIN}{R} + I_s
\end{align*}

Oh man, it doesn't look like $\vd$ is easy to solve here...so what do we do here?

\section{Graph it!}
If you recall from Algebra, if we have two unknowns and two equations, we can find the intersection of the two curves to find their solution.
We don't know $\vd, \id$, and we have equations for each, so why not graph them?

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=3in]{plot.png}
\end{figure}

So yeah, this works pretty well, and we can find a solution at $(\vd, \id) = (\SI{1.371}{\volt}, \SI{0.663}{\ampere})$, 
but it can cause a lot of unnecessary strain on your calculator because it has to plot so many points.
In addition, how did the calculator find the points in the first place?

\section{Newton's Method}
In fact, even the calculator had to use some sort of numerical method to approximate the intersection of the two curves! 
One popular and fairly reliable method is:

\begin{definition}
  \textbf{Newton's Method} is a first-order numerical approximation method to estimate the root of a function.
  In particular, given 
  \begin{align}
    f(x) &= 0 \\
    x_0 &= \text{initial guess}
  \end{align}
  iterate
  \begin{equation}
    x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
  \end{equation}
  until $\abs{f(x_n)} < \epsilon$, for some sufficiently small $\epsilon > 0$ that defines the desired accuracy.
\end{definition}

For our problem, we can define
\begin{equation}
  f(\vd) = I_S\pa{
    e^{\vd/\vt} - 1
  } - \frac{
    \VIN - \vd
  }{
    R
  } = 0
\end{equation}

We also need the derivative, 

\begin{equation}
  \dv{f(\vd)}{\vd} = 
  \frac{I_S}{\vt}e^{\vd/\vt} 
  + \frac{1
  }{
    R
  }
\end{equation}

Now, we just need to iterate with the following iterative sequence:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \VDZ &= v_{\text{D}_\text{initial}} \\
    v_{\text{D}_{i+1}} &= v_{\text{D}_i} - \frac{
      f(v_{\text{D}_i})
    }{
        f'(v_{\text{D}_i})
    }
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Choosing an initial guess of $\VDZ = \SI{1.3}{\volt}$ gives us a final convergence value of
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    (\vd, \id) = (\SI{1.371}{\volt}, \SI{0.663}{\ampere})
  }
\end{equation}
