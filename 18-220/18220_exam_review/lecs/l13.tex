\subsection*{Lecture 13}
Introduction to RFID circuits.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Draw an RFID scanner tag circuit schematic for tha scanner and tag side
  \item Why do we need to tune the RFID tags to be at the resonant frequency of the scanning circuit?
  \item What is amplitude modulation and how do we use it to transmit data? 
  Why don't we just send the bits directly instead of modulating them?
  \item Know that geometry (number of turns, width, height, shape) dictates 
  the inductance of your coil. Also know what would increase/decrease your 
  inductance. You might get a question about ``hey this person made an 
  inductor but is getting $X$ response on the plot. 
  What do you suggest they do to make their scanning circuit more accurate?''
