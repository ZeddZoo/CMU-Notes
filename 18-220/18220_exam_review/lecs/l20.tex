\subsection*{Lecture 20}

Small signal models, DC operating points, and analyzing small signal
gain at various DC operating points.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is a DC operating point?
  \item How is small signal different from large signal?
  \item Why do we care about small signal gain?
  \item Why is nonlinear gain generally bad?
  \item What region do we want to operate our MOSFETs in our gain circuits?
  Why do the other regions not work?
\end{enumerate}
