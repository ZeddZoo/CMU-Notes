\subsection*{Lecture 23}

Wireless communication, radio technologies.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Name a few communication technologies that preceded wireless communication.
  \item Name a few scientists that contributed to wireless technologies, their approximate time period, and what their contribution was.
  \item What is the Electromagnetic Spectrum? What is its relation to the radio spectrum and the visible light spectrum?
  \item Draw the schematic for a basic radio transmitter and receiver.
  \item Explain how AM modulation is done, and why we need it.
  \item What is the function of the Colpitts oscillator in Lab 6?
  \item Why do you need a buffer circuit in Lab 6? A buffer circuit has a gain of 1,
  which won't change the input signal shape, so why is it necessary? (\textit{Hint: try removing your buffer from your Lab 6 circuit})
