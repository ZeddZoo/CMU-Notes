\subsection*{Lecture 21}

Large signal analysis for MOSFETs, using MOSFETs to create an amplifier.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is a characteristic of the I-V graph of a MOSFET in the saturation region?
  Why is this useful for analog amplifiers?
  \item Given a MOSFET amplifier circuit, what are the steps to finding the small signal gain?
\end{enumerate}
