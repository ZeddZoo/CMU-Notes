\subsection*{Lecture 18}
Linearization, why we do it and why it's important.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Why do we prefer to have all of our elements to be linear in analysis?
  \item Describe the process for finding (this is more of a review question)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Thevenin equivalent
    \item Norton Equivalent
    \item Input impedance
    \item Output impedance
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Understand why you might use a Taylor series for a nonlinear element
  \item Briefly understand what the Newton method is doing
\end{enumerate}
