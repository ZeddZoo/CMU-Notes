\subsection*{Lecture 22}

Nonlinear feedback systems, Colpitts oscillator.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Why is negative feedback important for the stability of an opamp?
  \item Why is positive feedback useful for oscillators?
  \item What are some applications of oscillator circuits?
  \item Draw a Colpitts oscillator and briefly describe how each component works.
  \item Derive the LG, OLG, and CLG of a Colpitts oscillator circuit.
  \item Explain why a potentiometer can be used to create a voltage divider.
